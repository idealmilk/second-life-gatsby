# Second Life Gatsby

The project uses Node v14 and npm v6, so either download those or have a look at Node version managers such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github/tj/n).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Start developing**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.
